        <h3>1965</h3>
        <p>
            Two computers at MIT Lincoln Lab communicate with one another using packet-switching
            technology.
        </p>
        <h3>1968</h3>
        <p>
            Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN) unveils the final version of the Interface Message Processor (IMP)
            specifications. BBN wins ARPANET contract.
        </p>
        <h3>1969</h3>
        <p>
            On Oct. 29, UCLA’s Network Measurement Center, Stanford Research Institute (SRI), University of
            California-Santa Barbara and University of Utah install nodes. The first message is "LO," which was an
            attempt by student Charles Kline to "LOGIN" to the SRI computer from the university. However, the
            messagewas unable to be completed because the SRI system crashed.
        </p>
        <h3>1972</h3>
        <p>
            BBN’s Ray Tomlinson introduces network email. The Internetworking Working Group (INWG) forms
            to
            address need for establishing standard protocols.
        </p>
        <h3>1973</h3>
        <p>
            Global networking becomes a reality as the University College of London (England) and
            Royal Radar
            Establishment (Norway) connect to ARPANET. The term Internet is born.
        </p>
        <h3>1974</h3>
        <p>
            The first Internet Service Provider (ISP) is born with the introduction of a
            commercial version of
            ARPANET, known as Telenet.
        </p>
        <h3>1974</h3>
        <p>
            Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn (the duo said by many to be the Fathers of the Internet)
            publish "A Protocol
            for Packet Network Interconnection," which details the design of TCP.
        </p>
        <h3>1976</h3>
        <p>
            Queen Elizabeth II hits the “send button” on her first email.
        </p>
        <h3>1979</h3>
        <p>
            USENET forms to host news and discussion groups.
        </p>
        <h3>1981</h3>
        <p>
            The National Science Foundation (NSF) provided a grant to establish
            the Computer Science Network
            (CSNET) to provide networking services to university computer scientists.
        </p>
        <h3>1982</h3>
        <p>
            Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), as
            the protocol suite, commonly known
            as TCP/IP, emerge as the protocol for ARPANET. This results in the
            fledgling definition of the Internet as
            connected TCP/IP internets. TCP/IP remains the standard protocol for the
            Internet.
        </p>
        <h3>1983</h3>
        <p>
            The Domain Name System (DNS) establishes the familiar .edu,
            .gov, .com, .mil, .org, .net, and .int
            system for naming websites. This is easier to remember than the
            previous designation for websites, such as
            123.456.789.10.
        </p>
        <h3>1984</h3>
        <p>
            William Gibson, author of "Neuromancer," is the first to
            use the term "cyberspace."
        </p>
        <h3>1985</h3>
        <p>
            Symbolics.com, the website for Symbolics Computer
            Corp. in Massachusetts, becomes the first registered
            domain.
        </p>
        <h3>1986</h3>
        <p>
            The National Science Foundation’s NSFNET goes
            online to connected supercomputer centers at 56,000 bits
            per second — the speed of a typical dial-up computer
            modem. Over time the network speeds up and regional
            research and education networks, supported in part by
            NSF, are connected to the NSFNET backbone —
            effectively expanding the Internet throughout the United
            States. The NSFNET was essentially a network of
            networks that connected academic users along with the
            ARPANET.
        </p>
        <h3>1987</h3>
        <p>
            The number of hosts on the Internet exceeds
            20,000. Cisco ships its first router.
        </p>
        <h3>1989</h3>
        <p>
            World.std.com becomes the first commercial
            provider of dial-up access to the Internet.
        </p>
        <h3>1990</h3>
        <p>
            Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at CERN,
            the European Organization for Nuclear
            Research, develops
            HyperText Markup Language (HTML). This
            technology continues to have a large impact
            on how we navigate and
            view the Internet today.
        </p>
        <h3>1991</h3>
        <p>
            CERN introduces the World Wide Web
            to the public.
