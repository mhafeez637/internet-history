        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>
            The Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like nothing before.
            The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and computer set the stage for this unprecedented
            integration of
            capabilities.
            The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and
            a
            medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for
            geographic
            location. The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained
            investment and
            commitment to research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in
            packet
            switching, the government, industry and academia have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting
            new
            technology.
            Today, terms like “bleiner@computer.org” and “http://www.acm.org” trip lightly off the tongue of the random
            person
            on the street.

            This is intended to be a brief, necessarily cursory and incomplete history. Much material currently exists
            about the
            Internet, covering history, technology, and usage. A trip to almost any bookstore will find shelves of
            material
            written about the Internet.

            The Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the initial prototype of what is often called
            the
            National (or Global or Galactic) Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex and involves many
            aspects –
            technological, organizational, and community. And its influence reaches not only to the technical fields of
            computer
            communications but throughout society as we move toward increasing use of online tools to accomplish
            electronic
            commerce, information acquisition, and community operations.
